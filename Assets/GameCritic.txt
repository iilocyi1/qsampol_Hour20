The game is easy
The obstacles move slowly, the player moves fast enough to dodge, you have the phase ability

Explosions, some more particles, a ui

Making the game, coding the game, using assets from the asset store

The game was pre built, so I just had to copy the code word for word and do as the instructions said. 
As for the game, it was a simple and straight forward game with nothing tedious about the gameplay.
